      "Add the sugar to the warm water and stir until dissolved.",

      "In the bowl of an electric stand mixer, whisk together the flour and salt.",
      "Rub the lard into the flour mixture.",
      "Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in the yeast mixture.",
      "Stir with a wooden spoon until it starts to come together into a dough.",
      "Using a dough hook attachment on your mixer, mix the dough on a medium speed for 10 minutes. You can also knead by hand if preferred but make sure to do so for the full 10 minutes to get it nice and elastic.",
      "Sprinkle your work surface with a little rice flour. Turn the dough out onto the surface and shape into a ball with your hands.",
      "Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with a little oil and place in the dough. Cover loosely with cling film or a tea towel and leave in a warm place (around 25 degrees C is ideal) to proof for 1 to 1 ½ hours, or until roughly doubled in size.",
      "Turn out the dough onto your floured work surface and squash it down flat with your hands to knock out the gas. Then roughly roll it up into a sausage shape to make it easier to cut into pieces.",
      "For perfectly even rolls, you can weigh the dough and divide it by the number of rolls you’d like to make. The mixture will make 9-12 depending on the size of the rolls and your baking tray. Cut the dough into your sections and shape these into balls by rolling them with your hands.",
      "Dust the top of each roll with a little rice flour.",
      "Using your hands or a rolling pin, squash the rolls down into slightly flattened disks. They will rise back up again during the second proof.",
      "Line a large oven tray with baking paper. Place the rolls inside. Make sure they are touching to get that pull-apart effect.",
      "Cover the tray loosely with cling film or a tea towel and leave in a warm place to proof for another 1 to 1 ½ hours or until nicely plump and risen. About 15 minutes before your proofing time is up, preheat the oven to 230C.",
      "Bake the rolls for 15 minutes or until golden all over the top.",
      "Use the baking paper to lift the rolls out onto a cooling rack. Allow them to cool for 15 minutes or so before pulling apart."
